for vs while loop

for loop:
--> Entry Controlled Loop.
--> used when we know how many times we have to iterate.
--> use forloop when you want to iterate over an iterable.

while loop:
--> Entry Controlled Loop.
--> used when we dont know how many times we have to iterate but we know a condition till when we have to iterate.
--> use whileloop when you dont care what number in a sequence you are in, which item you are iterating through in a list and you just simply want to carry out some sort of functionality many, many times until some sort of condition you set.

Syntax:
while some_condition_is_true:
	# Do this...
	# Then do this...
	# Finally do this...
 
Tabs or Spaces?
    Python document says to use 4 spaces instead of 1 Tab for Indentation.
    why so?
    --> Spaces are the preferred indentation method.
    --> Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs.
    --> Python disallows mixing tabs and spaces for indentation.
