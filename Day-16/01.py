(*) Languages:
COBOL -> Common Business Oriented Language.
POP -> Procedural Oriented Programming Language.
OOP -> Object-Oriented Programming Language.

(*) Two most important things that make up an Object:
    1) Attributes (meaningful variables / data)
    2) Methods (functions / data's functionality)

(*) Classes and Objects
    --> A blueprint that specifies all the data and its functionality that an object should have is called class.
    --> The object is the actual thing instantiated from the blueprint called class.
    (NOTE: Classes are written in PascalCase)
