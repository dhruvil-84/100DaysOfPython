Debugging:

Tip 1: Describe the Problem.
    --> see what the code wants to do and what (problem) it does.
    --> understand what's actually going on.
    --> make your assumptions and try to solve the bug.

Tip 2: Reproduse the Bug.
    --> when does the error actually happen? find it; run multiple times.
    --> and based on that knowledge, fix the code.

Tip 3: Play computer.
    --> Think like an interpreter (like thonny ide does), find the problem and fix the bug.

Tip 4: Fix the errors (ONLY FOR IDE's LIKE VS CODE, REPLIT, etc....)
    --> either error will be highlighted with a red or yellow line ==> fix them.
    --> or error will be thrown by interpreter after running the code in the console ==> fix them by copy pasting the error in google (stackoverflow.com).

Tip 5: Print is your friend. (use print() function)

Tip 6: Use a Debugger
   --> pythontutor.com (visualize execution)
   --> Thonny ide 

Tip 7: CHAT-GPT it.
    --> if code produces no werror but it does not do what you want just copy paste the code and prompt what you want as output but what actually it outputs.

NOTE: 
    --> see the functions' description to get the hint why problem is occuring. (It'll help in the solving of the bug)
    --> first you try to debug yourself & if you cant find the bug then only CHAT-GPT it.
    --> more the bugs you solve, you are more better at it.
    --> take a break, have a nap or solve it on next day if you feel exhausted.
